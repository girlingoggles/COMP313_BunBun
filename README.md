Game Description:

  BunBun is a 3D 3rd person view small-scale game where you- a bubble of ocean water- rolls around eating smaller bubbles of lake water. You move around using WASD and space. The game is won by eating enough bubbles to get up to 100% health, and lost by rolling around too much and losing all health.
  
  The hardest part of the game to get working was both how the camera works (so the world din't spin nauseatingly) and the C++ node, both which took me inordinate amounts of time to get working. the C++ node is BunBunColor, a node in Drop's blueprints, which sets BunBun's material to a selected material (in this case lake water), gets a delay called on it for 0.1 seconds, then is called again to change the material back to ocean water.
   The most interesting part was creating BunBun and the Drops and getting them to interact within the world and with each other. My favourite part of the gameplay is when BunBun eats a Drop and changes its material for a moment and the Drop pops off the mortal coil with a dramatic sound. I find it very cathartic to just... roll around into the drops.
